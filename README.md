## Requirements
- You need to use Ninjabrain Bot (version 1.5 or higher). You can download it here.
- Make sure to enable the API option in the Ninjabrain Bot advanced settings,otherwise the overlay won't work.

## Getting started
- Download the [latest release](https://github.com/cylorun/ninbot-overlay/releases/latest).
- Run the downloaded file, and a window will open where you can configure stuff.
- Once set up, open the provided URL in any browser on a device connected to the same local network (PC, phone, laptop, etc.).

  ### If you are not on windows
  - Download the source code, [here](https://github.com/cylorun/ninbot-web-client/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
  - Unzip the folder
  - Make sure you have python 3.12+ installed (other versions might work too, but 3.12 is a safe options since that's what i've used to dev this)
  - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the directory of the project.
  - Then you can run `app.py`.
